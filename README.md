üè• Clinic Booking System Database
This project is a complete database management system for a clinic booking system, designed using MySQL. It's a simple, yet robust, relational database that manages medical specializations, doctors, patients, and their appointments.

üöÄ Features
Well-Structured Tables: Organizes data into logical entities: Specializations, Doctors, Patients, and Appointments.

Data Integrity: Uses primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE constraints to ensure data consistency and prevent invalid entries.

Clear Relationships: Establishes a one-to-many relationship between Specializations and Doctors, and a many-to-many relationship between Doctors and Patients through the Appointments table.

Example Data: The script includes sample data (INSERT statements) to make it easy to test and explore the database structure immediately after creation.

üìÅ Files
clinic_booking_system.sql: This single SQL file contains all the necessary commands to build the complete database. It includes:

CREATE DATABASE statement

CREATE TABLE statements for all four tables

FOREIGN KEY constraints to define relationships

INSERT INTO statements with example data

üîß How to Use
Open your MySQL client: Use a tool like MySQL Workbench, the MySQL command-line interface, or any other SQL editor.

Run the script: Execute the entire content of the clinic_booking_system.sql file.

Explore: The database ClinicBookingSystem will be created, and all tables will be populated with the sample data. You can now run queries to interact with the data, such as finding a patient's appointments or listing all doctors in a specific specialization.
